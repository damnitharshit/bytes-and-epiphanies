### A Log of My Journey in Computer Science As a Self-Learner

</div>

<br>

Welcome! This repository is my personal log as I navigate through the vast world of Computer Science and related technologies. 

Feel free to explore, utilize, and contribute. Happy coding!

### Structure
Each subject directory contains: 
1. Solutions/answers to exercises.
2. Code for course projects.
3. Notes made during learning.

### Why Log?
Keeping this log helps me: 
1. Structure my learning process.
2. Document concepts for better understanding and easier review.

### How Will I Do It?
My aims are to:
1. Master the fundamentals of Computer Science.
2. Specialize in areas of interest.
3. Build projects to apply acquired knowledge.

For fundamentals, I'll follow a modified version of the curriculum recommended by [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com).
