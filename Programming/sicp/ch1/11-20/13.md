# Exercise 1.13

Prove that $\sqrt{\text{Fib}(n)}$ is the closest integer to $\varphi^n/\sqrt{5}$ where $\varphi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$. **Hint:** Let $\varphi = (1 - \sqrt{5})/2$.

Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers to prove that $\text{Fib}(n) = (\varphi^n - \psi^n)/\sqrt{5}$.

Solution:

```
Welp, too much math
