# Exercise 1.18

Using the results of Exercise 1.16 and Exercise 1.17, devise a procedure that generates an iterative process for multiplying two integers in terms of adding, doubling, and halving and uses a logarithmic number of steps.

Solution:

```scheme
(define (halve n)
  (/ n 2))

(define (double n)
  (* 2 n))

(define (even? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))

(define (mul-iter a b c)
  (cond
    [(= b 0) c]
    [(even? b) (mul-iter (double a) (halve b) c)]
    [else (mul-iter a (- b 1) (+ c a))]))

(define (mul a b)
  (mul-iter a b 0))
```
