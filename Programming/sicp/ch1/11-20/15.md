# Exercise 1.15

Consider the following function:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x)
  (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

1. Determine how many times the procedure `p` is applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated.
2. Write the value of `n` as a logarithmic function of `a` to base 3, where `n` is the number of times the procedure `p` is applied when `(sine a)` is evaluated.

Solution:

```
(a) 5 times.
(b) Both are log(a)  
```
