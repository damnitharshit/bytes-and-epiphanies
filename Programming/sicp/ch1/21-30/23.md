# Exercise 1.23

The `smallest-divisor` procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of needless testing. After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2, there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers. 

This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor` should not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define a procedure `next` that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the `smallest-divisor` procedure to use `(next test-divisor)` instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)`.

With `timed-prime-test` incorporating this modified version of `smallest-divisor`, run the test for each of the 12 primes found in Exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. 

Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?

Solution:

I updated the code:

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (next n)
  (if (= n 2) 3 (+ n 2)))

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond
    [(> (square test-divisor) n) n]
    [(divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor]
    [else (find-divisor n (next test-divisor))]))

(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))

(define (odd? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 1))

(define (check-odd-range a b lim c)
  (cond
    [(or (= c lim) (= a b)) (newline)]
    [else
     (cond
       [(and (odd? a) (prime? a))
        (display a)
        (display " ")
        (set! c (+ c 1))])
     (check-odd-range (+ a 1) b lim c)]))

(define start (current-inexact-milliseconds))
(check-odd-range 10000000000000 100000000000000 3 0)
(define end (current-inexact-milliseconds))

(display "Time taken: ")
(display (- end start))
(newline)

(set! start (current-inexact-milliseconds))
(check-odd-range 100000000000000 1000000000000000 3 0)
(set! end (current-inexact-milliseconds))

(display "Time taken: ")
(display (- end start))
(newline)
```

And running this gave me the following result:

```
10000000000037 10000000000051 10000000000099 
Time taken: 24.09423828125
100000000000031 100000000000067 100000000000097 
Time taken: 84.87939453125
```

In conclusion, we got a speed up of about $196\ \%$.

This speed up is lower than the expected 200 because of the added function call, if statement etc.
