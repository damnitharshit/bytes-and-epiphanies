# Exercise 1.26

Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing Exercise 1.24. His `fast-prime?` test seems to run more slowly than his `prime?` test. Louis calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis’s code, they find that he has rewritten the `expmod` procedure to use an explicit multiplication, rather than calling `square`:

```scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base
                       (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))
```

"I don’t see what difference that could make," says Louis.

"I do," says Eva. "By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the Θ(log n) process into a Θ(n) process."

Explain.

Solution:

Because of applicative-order evaluation, the procedure now involves double the amount of work it previously had.

$$\Theta(\log(2^n)) = \Theta(n\times\log(2)) = \Theta(n)$$
