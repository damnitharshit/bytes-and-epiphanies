# Exercise 1.24

Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use `fast-prime?` (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise.

Since the Fermat test has Î˜(log n) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000?

Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

Solution:

I had to shorten the values because they were out of the limits for fast-prime to work.

with new limits, we have, with the original code,

```
10000019 10000079 10000103 
Time taken: 0.052978515625
10000019 10000079 10000103 
Time taken: 0.03759765625
```

And the updated code:

```
10000019 10000079 10000103 
Time taken: 0.048583984375
10000019 10000079 10000103 
Time taken: 0.03759765625
```

Although for smaller number `prime?` is faster, `fast-prime?` become much faster with larger and larger prime.
