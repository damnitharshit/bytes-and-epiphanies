# Exercise 1.22

Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called `runtime` that returns an integer specifying the amount of time the system has been running (measured, for example, in microseconds). The following `timed-prime-test` procedure, when called with an integer `n`, prints `n` and checks to see if `n` is prime. If `n` is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing the test.

```scheme
(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))))

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))
```

Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes` that checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger than:

- 1000
- 10,000
- 100,000
- 1,000,000

Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of  $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, you should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about 10 times as long as testing for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ prediction? Is your result compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required for the computation?

Solution:

I ran this code:

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond
    [(> (square test-divisor) n) n]
    [(divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor]
    [else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1))]))

(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))

(define (odd? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 1))

(define (check-odd-range a b lim c)
  (cond
    [(or (= c lim) (= a b)) (newline)]
    [else
     (cond
       [(and (odd? a) (prime? a))
        (display a)
        (display " ")
        (set! c (+ c 1))])
     (check-odd-range (+ a 1) b lim c)]))

(define start (current-inexact-milliseconds))
(check-odd-range 10000000000000 100000000000000 3 0)
(define end (current-inexact-milliseconds))

(display "Time taken: ")
(display (- end start))
(newline)

(set! start (current-inexact-milliseconds))
(check-odd-range 100000000000000 1000000000000000 3 0)
(set! end (current-inexact-milliseconds))

(display "Time taken: ")
(display (- end start))
(newline)
```

And this is the result:

```
10000000000037 10000000000051 10000000000099 
Time taken: 47.249267578125
100000000000031 100000000000067 100000000000097 
Time taken: 164.717529296875
```

Since $\dfrac{164.72}{47.25} \approx 3.49 \approx \sqrt{10}$, We can say that the observations do hold up.
