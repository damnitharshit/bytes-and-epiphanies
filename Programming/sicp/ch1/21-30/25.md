# Exercise 1.25

Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing `expmod`. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written:

```scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
```

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

Solution:

No, she is not correct as her expmod requires for the storage of the number returned by the `fast-expt` procedure, which could be very big and result in memory issues.
