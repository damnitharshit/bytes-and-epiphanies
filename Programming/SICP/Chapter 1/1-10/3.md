# Exercise 1.3

Deﬁne a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (sum-square-of-larger-nums n1 n2 n3)

  (define (sq x)
    (* x x))

  (define (min a b c)
    (cond
      [(and (< a b) (< a c)) a]
      [(and (< b a) (< b c)) b]
      [(and (< c a) (< c b)) b]))

  (- (+ (sq n1) (sq n2) (sq n3)) (sq (min n1 n2 n3))))

(sum-square-of-larger-nums 1 2 3)
```
