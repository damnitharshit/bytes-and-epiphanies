# Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she deﬁnes a new version of if:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond
    [predicate then-clause]
    [else else-clause]))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
> (new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5
> (new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x) guess (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

Solution:

```
Using the new-if results in infinite recursion as, unlike if, all the arguments of the new-if will be evaluated before the procedure is applied on them.
```
