# Exercise 1.8

**Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots** is based on the fact that if $y$ is an approximation to the cube root of $x$, then a better approximation is given by the value:

$$\frac{\frac{x}{y^2} + 2y}{3}$$

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.

Solution:

```scheme
(define (cube x)
  (* x x x))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (* guess guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (cube guess) x)) 0.0001))

(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 1.0 x))
```
